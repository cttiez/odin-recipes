<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The above photo displays a mouth-watering presentation of my
    favorite dish: sushi. In this photo, there are a few standard maki's
    with a beautfully orange colored salmon sashimi and nigiri. The green paste next
    to the salmon is wasabi, which can be <em>very</em> spicy. The pink stuff next to it
    is ginger, and its purpose is to cleanse your taste buds between each bite.

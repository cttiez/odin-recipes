# odin-recipes

In this project, I created a repository with different recipes of my favorite foods. The index.html, which I learned is often the main page, provided links to different recipes I created. In those recipes, I inserted an image with a small description of the recipe. I kept in mind when inserting an image to use the "alt" element to describe the photo. The height and width elements allowed me to adjust the size of the photo.

With the unordered and ordered lists, I included some nested lists in it as well to experiment with how nesting was in HTML. I have experience with nesting when learning Python and other coding languages in the past.
